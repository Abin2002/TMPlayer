/**
 * "New episodes of shows you watch" (CP76): "Episode 5 of Harbour Notes is in Video Club", with
 * Play, when a show the viewer is watching posts an episode they have not seen. Narrower than
 * [NewVideoAlerts], which says every new video in a starred chat: this one says only the next
 * episodes of shows already under way, in whichever chat posts them.
 *
 * A show is under way when Continue watching holds one of its episodes, or one is marked watched
 * ([shows]). The chats read are those the shows were watched in and the starred ones, at most
 * [MAX_CHATS], each a page of its newest videos, as [NewVideoAlerts] reads them. What is new is
 * per chat ([Diff.seen]): a chat seen for the first time only sets its mark. An episode counts
 * when it is past the furthest one watched in its season, or in a later season, and has not been
 * announced before ([toldKey]), so the same episode posted in two chats is said once. The kids lock
 * leaves its hidden chats unread, and with the app lock on ("Ask when the app opens") the
 * notification names no show, no chat and offers no Play.
