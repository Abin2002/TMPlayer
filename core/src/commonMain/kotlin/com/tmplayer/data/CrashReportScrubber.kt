/**
 * Cuts a crash report down to what the privacy page promises, and nothing more.
 *
 * The page says a report is the stack trace, the app version, the Android version and the device
 * model, or on a computer the operating system and its version with no device at all. The SDK
 * fills in a great deal besides: timezone, locale, battery, memory, storage, screen, connection
 * type, boot time, permissions, an installation identifier, and on a computer the host name and
 * the Java runtime. Rather than chase each of those by name, and miss whatever the next SDK version
 * adds, the device, OS and app contexts are rebuilt from scratch with only the allowed fields, and
 * every other context, tag and extra goes.
 *
 * Text that survives (exception messages, stack frame variables) has file paths and anything that
 * looks like a video file name replaced, since that is where the name of what somebody was
 * watching would otherwise turn up. A Windows path goes too: the user's folder name is in it.
 *
 * Shared by the Android app and the desktop, which pass [keepDevice] false.
