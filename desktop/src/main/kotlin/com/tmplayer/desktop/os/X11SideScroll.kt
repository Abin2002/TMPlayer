/**
 * Sideways scrolling on Linux, and the mouse's real Back and Forward buttons there.
 *
 * X11 sends a touchpad's two finger sideways swipe, and a mouse's tilt wheel, as presses of
 * buttons 6 and 7. The JDK's X11 toolkit has no sideways wheel event, so it hands those on as
 * ordinary presses of Java's buttons 4 and 5 (`XWindow.handleButtonPressRelease`: every button
 * past the wheel's 4 and 5 is renumbered two down), which are exactly the numbers Compose reads
 * as [androidx.compose.ui.input.pointer.PointerButton.Back] and Forward. So on Linux a sideways
 * swipe went back a page, a burst of them went back through every screen, and nothing that
 * scrolls sideways (the Home carousel, its rows) ever saw a scroll at all. A mouse's own side
 * buttons, X11's 8 and 9, arrive as Java's 6 and 7, which Compose does not call Back.
 *
 * [install] puts a queue in front of AWT's that turns each of those presses into the sideways
 * wheel step it is: a wheel event with Shift held, which is how Compose Desktop (and the JDK on
 * macOS, for a trackpad) spells a horizontal scroll. Their releases and clicks are dropped. The
 * side buttons are renumbered to 4 and 5, so Back and Forward on the mouse work as on Windows.
 * Nothing changes on Windows or macOS, or on a toolkit other than X11's.
