/**
 * Lays the items [build] adds out as grouped cards: every run of rows between two section titles
 * (or notes) becomes one card on a phone, its first and last rows rounded and the ones between
 * divided by an inset line.
 *
 * The pages add their rows with the plain `item { }` they always did; this scope collects them,
 * works out where each one sits in its run, and only then hands them to the list. A section title
 * goes in with [sectionTitle] and a line of small print under a group with [settingsNote], which
 * is how a run is ended.
 *
 * A television keeps one card per row instead: there a row fills with the focus colour, and a
 * block of colour inside a larger card reads less clearly from a sofa than a card of its own.
