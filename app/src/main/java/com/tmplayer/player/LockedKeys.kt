/**
 * What a key does while the player's screen is locked, on a phone with a keyboard, a tablet, a
 * television's remote, a Fire TV remote or a game controller alike.
 *
 * The lock is for a video handed to a child, or a phone propped on a lap, so almost every key is
 * ignored, the media keys and the D-pad included: a press only brings up the unlock pill, which
 * says how to get out. Two exceptions. The volume keys are the system's, as they are under any
 * lock screen, and nobody locks a player to stop the sound being turned down. And holding a
 * select key (OK on a remote, Enter on a keyboard, A on a controller) for [HOLD_MS] unlocks: a
 * remote has no touch screen to tap the pill on, and a held press is the one thing a mash of the
 * buttons does not do by accident. Home stays the system's on every device, which no app can
 * take away and none should.
