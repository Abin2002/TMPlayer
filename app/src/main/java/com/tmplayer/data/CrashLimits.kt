/**
 * How many reports one device may send in a day, so a crash loop stays inside Sentry's free plan.
 *
 * The plan takes 5,000 errors a month for every device together. A crash on every start, on a
 * few hundred phones and televisions at once, would spend that in a day and leave nothing for
 * the rest of the month. So each device sends the same crash (the exception type and the top
 * frame of the app's own code) at most once a day, and no more than [MAX_PER_DAY] reports a day
 * of any kind. Sentry's own spike protection is the second line, for what this cannot see.
 *
 * Counted in a small private file next to the pending crash, by the UTC day of [clock]. The file
 * holds the day, the count and the crashes already sent that day, as class and method names; no
 * message, no file and nothing about the viewer.
